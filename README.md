# World Happiness Analysis (Descriptive EDA)

##  Project Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the key socio-economic factors influencing happiness across countries using **descriptive data analysis**.  
Rather than building a predictive model, this project focuses on **exploring relationships, patterns, and insights** that explain variations in happiness scores.

## Analysis Performed
1. Data loading and initial inspection  
2. Identification of numerical and categorical features  
3. Univariate analysis using summary statistics and distributions  
4. Correlation analysis among socio-economic factors  
5. Correlation analysis with happiness score (target variable)  
6. Regression plots to visually examine relationships between features and happiness

##  Key Insights
- **Social support** shows the strongest correlation with happiness, highlighting the importance of community and interpersonal relationships.
- **Economic prosperity (GDP per capita)** and **healthy life expectancy** are strongly associated with higher happiness scores.
- **Freedom to make life choices** contributes significantly to happiness beyond economic factors.
- **Perceptions of corruption** show a weaker but still meaningful relationship with happiness, reflecting the role of trust and governance.

## Conclusion
Happiness is a **multi-dimensional concept** influenced by economic, health, social, and institutional factors.  
This analysis demonstrates that while wealth and health are important, **social support emerges as the most influential factor** in determining happiness across countries.

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses on identifying associations rather than causal relationships.
- Some qualitative factors influencing happiness may not be fully captured.
- The study is based on data from a single year and may not reflect long-term trends.
